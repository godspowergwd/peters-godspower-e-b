# Common

This directory is intended for code and resources that are shared between the `client` and `server` applications, or across different parts of the backend.
This could include:
- Data validation schemas (e.g., for API requests/responses)
- Shared utility functions
- Type definitions (e.g., TypeScript interfaces/types)
- Configuration files or constants used by both frontend and backend
- Any other modules that don't strictly belong to either the client or server but are needed by both.
